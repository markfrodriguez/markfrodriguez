Ever since my parents bought my brother and I our first [Apple IIe][1], I’ve been fascinated with technology. It started out writing “silly games” in Basic, taking apart numerous household electronics (sorry mom), and having a strong desire to create things (I vividly remember the awful smell of burnt eyebrows when the solder gun “misbehaved”).

Eventually, I attended the [University of Miami][2] and studied biomedical engineering receiving both a bachelor’s and master’s degree in the subject. While attending university and working at [Jackson Memorial Hospital][3], I started a consulting company, which continues to employ me (and others).

While I’m quite proud of my educational and professional achievements, my greatest joy is my family. I met my wife while in high school, and now have the privilege of partnering with her as we raise our six children.

Ever since my parents bought my brother and I our first [Apple IIe][1], I’ve been fascinated with technology. It started out writing “silly games” in Basic, taking apart numerous household electronics (sorry mom), and having a strong desire to create things (I vividly remember the awful smell of burnt eyebrows when the solder gun “misbehaved”).

Eventually, I attended the [University of Miami][2] and studied biomedical engineering receiving both a bachelor’s and master’s degree in the subject. While attending university and working at [Jackson Memorial Hospital][3], I started a consulting company, which continues to employ me (and others) till this day. I'm starting the sandbox in an attempt to keep “side projects” separate from “real work”.

While I’m quite proud of my educational and professional achievements, my greatest joy is my family. I met my wife while in high school, and now have the privilege of partnering with her as we raise our six children.

In the off-chance you’d like to connect, I can be reached on [Twitter][4].
